## âœ… Tips for Success  
To get the most out of these examples:

- **Run the code** â€“ Execute the examples to see how they work in practice.  
- **Experiment freely** â€“ Modify the code to observe how changes affect the output.  
- **Recreate from memory** â€“ Try coding the examples from scratch without looking at the originals.  
- **Add your own twist** â€“ Implement additional features or enhancements to challenge yourself.  
- **Document your changes** â€“ Write comments explaining what you changed and why.  
- **Debug intentionally** â€“ Introduce small errors on purpose and learn how to fix them.  
- **Compare multiple solutions** â€“ If there are different ways to solve the same problem, try them and compare the results.  
- **Ask questions** â€“ If you donâ€™t understand something, discuss it in class or with your peers.

### ðŸ“Œ Reminder  
Learning to program is an active process. Donâ€™t just read the codeâ€”**break it, fix it, and make it your own!**
